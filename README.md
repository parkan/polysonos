polysonos
=========

Switch the OS X Sonos controller between different households and customer IDs without resetting + pressing buttons all the time. Using `load` will politely restart Sonos.app to make the changes take effect immediately.

```./polysonos save [name]```

```./polysonos load [name]```

NOTE: the new sonos controllers (in beta as of 4/2014) appear to possibly natively support switching between multiple systems: http://www.sonos.com/newcontrollerapp
